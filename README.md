# Unicorny
It is a unibody ergonomic keyboard inspired by the ferris-sweep (34 keys).
The aim of this keyboard is to have a layout as close as possbile to the ferris-sweep but in a unibody frame, 
to improve connection stability and because I found it easier to carry around.

## Features
- Wired/wireless
- Hotswap choc v1
- ProMicro footprint (designed with ninenano v2 in mind)
- Oled screen (optional)
- Power Switch (Wireless)

## Firmware
I choose Zmk and the config can be found [here](https://github.com/Riccardo-merli94/zmk/tree/main/app/boards/shields/unicorny).
I built the firmware locally, so the repository contains a fork of zmk, if you want to build it using the github actions, you'll need to follow the zmk doc.
